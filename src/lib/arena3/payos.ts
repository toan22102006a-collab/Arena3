 * The payOS gateway, wrapped so the rest of the app never talks to it directly.
 *
 * Three things this file exists to guarantee:
 *
 *  - **The app runs without credentials.** payOS is optional. An unconfigured
 *    install must behave exactly as it did before — cash, card and bank
 *    transfer at the desk — not crash on boot or hide the till behind an
 *    error. Nothing here throws at import time.
 *  - **Order codes are derived, never invented.** payOS wants a number, unique
 *    per merchant, inside the JS safe-integer range. The usual
 *    `Date.now()`-based guess collides when two customers pay in the same
 *    millisecond; this app already has a gapless counter, so the code comes
 *    from there.
 *  - **Secrets stay server-side.** `process.env` only — no `VITE_` prefix, so
 *    the checksum key can never reach a browser bundle.
