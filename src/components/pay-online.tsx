/**
 * Take an online payment through payOS.
 *
 * Built for the counter first, because that is how this centre actually works:
 * the customer is standing at the desk, reception raises the link, and the
 * customer scans the QR off reception's screen with their banking app. The same
 * component serves a member paying on their own phone — there the QR is beside
 * the point, so a "Open payment page" button is offered as well.
 *
 * Nothing here decides that money arrived. The dialog polls
 * `/payments/online/:id/verify`, which asks payOS, and only payOS's answer
 * posts the payment. Reception has no "received" button to press and no way to
 * mark this paid by hand — that is the whole difference between this and the
 * cash button beside it.
