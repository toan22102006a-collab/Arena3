description: Design and build production-grade frontend interfaces, context first - capture PRODUCT.md (strategy) and DESIGN.md (visual system), pull reusable tokens into a design system, and apply shared UX/UI rules (color, typography, layout, motion, accessibility, anti-patterns) for brand and product surfaces. Its capabilities (discover, prepare, validate, review) are routed automatically by hs-brainstorm, hs-plan, hs-build, and hs-code-review, and can also be invoked directly. Use when the user wants to design, redesign, build, review, or polish a website, landing page, dashboard, app UI, component, form, or design system, even if they only say "make this look better" or "set up design tokens". Not for backend APIs (hs-backend-development) or CI/CD and infrastructure (hs-devops).

# Frontend Development Skill

Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working
code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

The design flows in this skill are ported from
[fk-skills](https://github.com/ThinhTP204/fk-skills). Provenance
and every deviation from upstream are recorded in `references/UPSTREAM.md`.

<HARD-GATE>
See `../_shared/hard-gate.md` for the shared gate shape (`{scope}` = "a plan exists or the user has explicitly requested implementation").
</HARD-GATE>

## When to Use

- Designing, redesigning, or polishing a website, landing page, dashboard,
  app shell, component, form, settings page, onboarding, or empty state
- Capturing a project's strategy and visual system as PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md
- Consolidating repeated UI patterns and hard-coded values into shared tokens
- Any UI task where the result should not read as generic AI output

## Setup

Complete these setup steps before proceeding; they establish project context and the applicable workflow.

1. Read the project context once per session (skip if you already did in this conversation): PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md at the project root, or under `.agents/context/` or `docs/` (case-insensitive), with your native file tool. **If PRODUCT.md is missing, stop and follow `references/setup.md` before doing anything else.** A missing DESIGN.md does not block the task; setup and `spec` offer to create it.
2. If the user invoked one of the capabilities below directly, or a workflow routed you here, read the matching reference next. The reference defines the flow and prevents skipped work.
3. Familiarize yourself with any existing design system, conventions, and components in the code. Read at least one project file (CSS / tokens / theme / a representative component or page). **Required even when you've loaded a flow reference in step 2.** Don't reinvent the wheel; use what's there when it works, branch out when the UX wins.
4. Read the matching register reference. **This is non-optional; skipping it produces generic output.** If the project is marketing, a landing page, a campaign, long-form content, or a portfolio (design IS the product), read `references/brand.md`. If it is app UI, admin, a dashboard, or a tool (design SERVES the product), read `references/product.md`. Pick by first match: (1) task cue ("landing page" vs "dashboard"); (2) surface in focus (the page, file, or route being worked on); (3) `register` field in PRODUCT.md.
5. **If the project is brand-new (no existing CSS tokens / theme / committed brand colors found in step 3)**, choose the brand seed color deliberately before composing anything: one OKLCH anchor for the primary brand color, then compose the rest of the palette (bg, surface, ink, accent, muted) around it using the Color & Theme rules below. Do not default to the first color the category suggests. **Skip this step if step 3 found committed brand colors in existing tokens; in that case identity-preservation wins.**

## Design guidance

Produce ready-to-ship, production-grade code, not prototypes or starting points. Take no shortcuts unless the user asks for them (when in doubt, ask). Don't stop until arriving at a complete implementation (beautiful, responsive, fast, precise, bug-free, on brand). You take attention to detail seriously: every page, section or component crafted is battle tested using the tools available to you (browser screenshotting, computer use, etc). Claude is capable of extraordinary work. Don't hold back.

### General rules

#### Color

- **Verify contrast.** Body text must hit ≥4.5:1 against its background; large text (≥18px or bold ≥14px) needs ≥3:1. Placeholder text needs the same 4.5:1, not the muted-gray default. The most common failure: muted gray body text on a tinted near-white. If the contrast is even close, bump the body color toward the ink end of the ramp; light gray "for elegance" is the single biggest reason AI designs feel hard to read.
- Gray text on a colored background looks washed out. Use a darker shade of the background's own hue, or a transparency of the text color.

#### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Don't pair fonts that are similar but not identical (two geometric sans-serifs, two humanist sans-serifs). Pair on a contrast axis (serif + sans, geometric + humanist) or use one family in multiple weights.
- Hero / display heading ceiling: clamp() max ≤ 6rem (~96px). Above that the page is shouting, not designing.
- Display heading letter-spacing floor: ≥ -0.04em. Anything tighter and letters touch; cramped, not "designed".
- Use `text-wrap: balance` on h1–h3 for even line lengths; `text-wrap: pretty` on long prose to reduce orphans.

#### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Flexbox for 1D, Grid for 2D. Don't default to Grid when `flex-wrap` would be simpler.
- For responsive grids without breakpoints: `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))`.
- Build a semantic z-index scale (dropdown → sticky → modal-backdrop → modal → toast → tooltip). Never arbitrary values like 999 or 9999.

#### Motion
- Motion should be intentional, and not be an afterthought. consider it as part of the build.
- Don't animate CSS layout properties unless truly needed.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.
- Use libraries for more advanced motion needs (e.g. motion, gsap, anime.js, lenis etc)
- Reduced motion is not optional. Every animation needs a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` alternative: typically a crossfade or instant transition.
- Staggering the items within one list is legitimate. The tell is the uniform reflex (one identical entrance applied to every section), not motion itself; each reveal should fit what it reveals. Suppressing the reflex is never a reason to ship a page with no motion at all.
- Reveal animations must enhance an already-visible default. Don't gate content visibility on a class-triggered transition; transitions pause on hidden tabs and headless renderers, so the reveal never fires and the section ships blank.
- Premium motion materials are not just transform/opacity. Blur, backdrop-filter, clip-path, mask, and shadow/glow are part of the palette when they materially improve the effect and stay smooth.

#### Interaction

- Dropdowns rendered with `position: absolute` inside an `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` container will be clipped. Use the native `<dialog>` / popover API, `position: fixed`, or a portal to escape the stacking context.

### New projects only (when no prior work exists)

#### Color & Theme

- Use OKLCH.
- **The cream / sand / beige body bg is the saturated AI default of 2026.** The whole warm-neutral band (OKLCH L 0.84-0.97, C < 0.06, hue 40-100) reads as cream/sand/paper/parchment regardless of what you call it. Token names like `--paper`, `--cream`, `--sand`, `--bone`, `--flour`, `--linen`, `--parchment`, `--wheat`, `--biscuit`, `--ivory` are tells in themselves. If the brief is "warm, traditional, family-coastal-Italian" or "magazine-warm" or "editorial-restraint", DO NOT translate that into a near-white warm-tinted bg; that's the AI move. Pick: (a) a saturated brand color as the body (terracotta, oxblood, deep ochre, near-black), (b) a true off-white at chroma 0 (or chroma toward the brand's own hue, not toward warmth-by-default), or (c) a darker mid-tone tinted neutral that's clearly the brand's own. "Warmth" in the brand is carried by accent + typography + imagery, not by body bg.
- Tinted neutrals: add 0.005–0.015 chroma toward the brand's hue. Don't default-tint toward warm or cool "because the brand feels that way"; that's the cross-project monoculture move.
- When picking a theme: Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe.".Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Tiny uppercase tracked eyebrow above every section.** The 2023-era kicker (small all-caps text with wide tracking, "ABOUT" "PROCESS" "PRICING" above each heading) is now the saturated AI scaffold; it appears on 55-95% of generations regardless of brief, which is the definition of a tell. One named kicker as a deliberate brand system is voice; an eyebrow on every section is AI grammar. Choose a different cadence.
- **Numbered section markers as default scaffolding (01 / 02 / 03).** Putting `01 · About / 02 · Process / 03 · Pricing` above every section is the eyebrow trope one tier deeper: reach for it because "landing pages do this" and you're scaffolding by reflex. Numbers earn their place when the section actually IS a sequence (a real 3-step process, an ordered flow, a typed timeline) and the order carries information the reader needs. One deliberate numbered sequence on one page is voice; numbered eyebrows on every section across the site is AI grammar.
- **Text that overflows its container.** Long heading words plus large clamp scales plus narrow grids cause headline overflow on tablet/mobile. Test the heading copy at every breakpoint; if it overflows, reduce the clamp max or rewrite the copy. The viewport is part of the design.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the absolute bans above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone, it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's reflex-reject aesthetic lanes (`references/brand.md`) list catches the currently-saturated families.

## Capabilities

The workflow skills call these on their own (`../_shared/domain-routing.md`):
the user picks `hs-brainstorm`, `hs-plan`, `hs-build`, `hs-code-review`, or
`hs-ship`, and the workflow decides when frontend applies. Each capability can
also be invoked directly.

| Capability | Called by | Direct invocation | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| `discover` | `hs-brainstorm`, for a new UI surface | `hs-frontend-development brief [feature]` | `references/design-brief.md` |
| `prepare` | `hs-plan` (context), `hs-build` | `setup` writes PRODUCT.md and hands off to `spec` for DESIGN.md; the production bar is loaded by `hs-build` | `references/setup.md`, `references/spec.md`, `references/build.md` |
| `validate` | `hs-build`, `hs-code-review`, `hs-ship` | `hs-frontend-development check [target]` | `references/check.md` |
| `review` | `hs-code-review`, for a change that reshapes what users see | `hs-frontend-development review [target]` | `references/review.md` |
| finish step | `hs-build`, once the phase is otherwise done | `hs-frontend-development finish [target]` | `references/finish.md` |
| on demand | none | `hs-frontend-development tokens [target]` | `references/tokens.md` |

### Direct invocation

1. **No argument**: the user is asking "what should I do?" Read the project context (Setup step 1), then lead with the **2-3 highest-value next actions**, each with a one-line reason: PRODUCT.md missing → `setup`; DESIGN.md missing while code exists → `spec`; a new surface to build → start `hs-brainstorm`; existing UI never reviewed → `review <surface>`; drift from a shared system → `tokens`. Follow with the table above. **Never auto-run one; the recommendation is a suggestion the user confirms.**
2. **First word matches an invocation** (`brief`, `setup`, `spec`, `check`, `review`, `finish`, `tokens`): load its reference and follow it. Everything after the name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match, but the intent clearly maps to one capability** (e.g. "document the design system" → `spec`, "clean up repeated buttons" → `tokens`, "fix the spacing" → `space`, "rewrite this error message" → `copy`): load that reference and proceed as if invoked. If two could fit, ask once which.
4. **No clear match**: general design invocation. Apply the Setup steps, the Design guidance above, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

**Topic references** (`references/space.md`, `type.md`, `motion.md`, `color.md`, `responsive.md`, `copy.md`, `interaction-design.md`) are consulted by `prepare` (the build flow) through the brief's "Recommended References", or loaded directly when the task is about that topic. Each ends with a Reference Material section holding the deep guidance, and hands off to the `hs-build` finish step for the final pass.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; capabilities don't re-run it. If one finds PRODUCT.md missing, it runs `setup` first as a blocker, then resumes the original task.

## References

- `references/design-brief.md` - discovery interview and the confirmed design brief (`discover`)
- `references/build.md` - build flow and production bar (`prepare`, used by `hs-build`)
- `references/finish.md` - final polish pass (the `hs-build` finish step)
- `references/check.md` - technical audit (`validate`)
- `references/review.md` - UX critique with heuristics, cognitive load, and personas (`review`)
- `references/space.md`, `references/type.md`, `references/motion.md`, `references/color.md`, `references/responsive.md`, `references/copy.md`, `references/interaction-design.md` - topic references: layout and spacing, typography, motion, color, responsive adaptation, UX copy, interaction design
- `references/brand.md` - register for surfaces where design IS the product
- `references/product.md` - register for surfaces where design SERVES the product
- `references/UPSTREAM.md` - where these references come from and what differs from upstream
